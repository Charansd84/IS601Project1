      <h3>Devlopment</h3>
      <p> The challenge of building a microservices workflow is that you need a standard set of tools and processes that support all these different modes of development. You don't want one set of tools for prototyping, and another set of tools and workflow for production.

In addition, a microservices architecture, the development teams are typically responsible for a service and not just the code. This implies that the development teams need operational skills and capabilities, e.g., monitoring and deployment.

Luckily, Kubernetes has become a de facto standard for running cloud native applications. The Kubernetes ecosystem provides a robust set of operational infrastructure with which to run microservices. So you don't need to start from scratch. </p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.</p>
