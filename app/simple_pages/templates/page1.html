      <h3>About Branches</h3>
        <p>Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.</p>

      <h3>Megres</h3>
     <p>When you select the Squash and merge option on a pull request on GitHub.com, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Commits</h3>
        <p>git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times. You should make new commits often, based around logical units of change.</p>
